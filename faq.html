                            We require 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling. Cancellations with less than 24 hours notice may incur a 50% cancellation fee.

                            We recommend booking at least 3-5 days in advance to secure your preferred time slot, especially for evenings and weekends. However, we do our best to accommodate same-day appointments when possible - just give us a call to check availability.

                            Yes, when availability permits. Call us in the morning to check for same-day openings. We prioritize acute injuries and urgent cases when possible. For the best chance of getting your preferred time, we recommend booking in advance.

                            Your first session includes a comprehensive assessment. We'll discuss your health history, current concerns, goals, and lifestyle. I'll perform a physical assessment to identify problem areas and movement patterns. Then we'll begin treatment based on your needs. The 60-minute session is recommended for first-time clients to allow adequate time for assessment and treatment.

                            Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows easy access to the areas being treated. For lower body work, shorts are ideal. For upper body work, a tank top or sports bra works well. You'll be appropriately draped during treatment, and only the area being worked on will be exposed. Your comfort and modesty are priorities.

                            Yes, please arrive 5-10 minutes early for your first visit to complete intake forms and discuss your health history. For subsequent visits, arriving 5 minutes early is sufficient. This ensures we can start your treatment on time and you receive the full session duration.

                            Some discomfort is normal during deep tissue work, especially in areas with significant tension or trigger points. However, it should never be unbearable. I work within your pain tolerance and constantly check in with you. The discomfort should feel like "good pain" - therapeutic rather than harmful. Communication is key - always let me know if the pressure is too much.

                            This depends on your condition and goals. For acute injuries, you might need weekly sessions initially. For chronic conditions, weekly or fortnightly sessions are common. For maintenance and injury prevention, monthly sessions often suffice. After your assessment, I'll recommend a treatment frequency based on your specific needs.

                            30 minutes (existing clients only): Targeted treatment of one specific area, ideal for maintenance. 60 minutes: Comprehensive treatment with assessment, perfect for first visits and treating multiple related areas. 90 minutes: Extended treatment for multiple unrelated areas, complex conditions, or full-body relaxation. Most clients find 60 minutes optimal for their needs.

                            Yes, but timing matters. For very acute injuries (first 48-72 hours), gentle techniques are used to reduce inflammation and promote healing. After the acute phase, more intensive treatment can begin. For serious injuries, I may recommend seeing a doctor first or coordinate treatment with your healthcare provider.

                            Drink plenty of water to help flush out released toxins. Avoid intense exercise for 24 hours after deep tissue work. Some soreness is normal for 24-48 hours - this is your body's healing response. Apply heat or ice as recommended. Follow any self-care exercises or stretches provided. Rest and allow your body to integrate the treatment.

Remedial massage addresses specific musculoskeletal issues, chronic pain, and rehabilitation.

                            Not at all! While sports massage techniques are designed for athletes, they're highly effective for anyone with muscle tension, pain, or mobility issues. Office workers, manual laborers, and anyone dealing with physical stress can benefit from sports massage techniques.
